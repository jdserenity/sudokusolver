## sudokusolver

Currently this works for puzzles up to 5 star difficulty level in the USA TODAY Jumbo Puzzle Book 2. (Which also happens to have been the inspiration for this project)

Super simple, a little under 200 lines. You've probably seen one of these before, but the interesting thing is that I didn't look up any algorithms or any guidelines for doing this. I simply started from scratch. 

That probably means that this isn't the fast way of implementing a sudoku solver, and admittedly it doesn't solve super scary puzzles with like only 17 givens, but I enjoyed building this and trying to figure out how to make it work from zero to one!

Example unsolved:

Solved:

As you can see it's very fast.
